NEURAL NETWORKS:

NeuralNetworkV1: The most basic neural network, no backpropagation algorithm. Simply updates 
weights and attempts to get near correct output. Only works properly with
extremely small data sets (and I mean extremely small). There are only two
layers, the input nodes and the output nodes. Will identify patterns, even
if the patterns aren't there.

NeuralNetworkV2: A slightly more advanced neural network, now includes a backpropagation
algorithm. (update later)
